# Maximum-meetings-for-positive-effectiveness-meetings
This is a Python solution for a HackerRank question posed to find the maximum number of meetings that can be scheduled before an effectiveness index becomes negative.

The full question is: 
â€œA product manager has to organize *n* meetings with different people. Meeting with each person results in an increase or decrease in the effectiveness index of the manager. The manager wants to organize the meetings such that the index remains positive for as many meetings as possible. Find the maximum number of meetings for which the effectiveness index is positive. The index at the beginning is *0*.

**Note**: After the meetings begin, the index must remain above 0 to be positive.

***Example***

*n = 4*

*effectiveness = [1, -20, 3, -2]*

One optimal meeting order is *[3, -2, 1, -20]*. The index is positive for the first three meetings, after which it is 3 -2 + 1 = 1. So the answer is 3. There is no way to have *4* meetings with a positive index.

**Function Description**

Complete the function *maxMeetings* in the editor.

*maxMeetings* has the following parameter:

*int effectiveness[n]:* *the increase or decrease effectiveness for each meeting*.

**Returns**

*int:* the maximum possible number of meetings while maintaining a positive index.
